# Drishya Vyakhya
This is a image captioning web interface tool which can accept images from camera and local images, dragged images from anywhere . Specially made for PW Skills Hackathon for AI theme. This repo uses two ML models to generate test from images in english language and return an audio file as well . This repo can be enhanced further for blind people where they only have to click a button on their spectacles and they would get what's on their front right into their ears.
This tool requires GPU to run online so if you want to test this on your SmartPhone or PC you need to first run this on kaggle and generate a link using ngrock https://www.kaggle.com/localserver/chitra-vyakhya-pw-hackathon
