This is a image captioning web interface tool which can accept images from camera and local images, dragged images from anywhere . Specially made for PW Skills Hackathon for AI theme. This repo uses two ML models to generate test from images in english language and return an audio file as well . This repo can be enhanced further for blind people where they only have to click a button on their spectacles and they would get what's on their front right into their ears.
